*Completed final project for Coursera course in data science: "Getting and Cleaning Data"*  
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project

## Introduction to project
*From the Coursera project description:*
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the website where the data was obtained: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

*Here are the data for the project:* [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

## Running the script:

**I have created an R script called *run_analysis.R* that does the following:**  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the dataset in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**To run the script:**  
For my R script to import the data properly, make sure you have saved the script "run_analysis.R" is in the same directory as the eight data files: 1) activity_labels.txt, 2) features.txt, 3) X_train.txt, 4) y_train.txt, 5) subject_train.txt, 6) X_test.txt, 7) y_test.txt, and 8) subject_test.txt. 

Please note that when you download and unzip the source datafile, some of these files will be nested in subdirectories "/train" and "/test". For the sake of sharing everything on Github, I have put all files in the same directory.

Once all files are in the same directory, open "run_analysis.R" (I recommend in RStudio) and click the 'Run' button at the top right of the script window.

## Codebook

### Subjects (*n* = 30)

The people who participated in the study are simply identified with a number 1-30. Each row in the 'train/subject_train.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt' files identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample.

### Activities (*n* = 6)

The different activities include:  
* walking  
* walking upstairs  
* walking downstairs  
* sitting  
* standing  
* laying  

### Features (*n* = 561)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  
* tBodyAcc-XYZ  
* tGravityAcc-XYZ  
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
* tBodyGyro-XYZ  
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ  
* tBodyAccMag  
* tGravityAccMag  
* tBodyAccJerkMag  
* tBodyGyroMag  
* tBodyGyroJerkMag  
* fBodyAcc-XYZ  
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ  
* fBodyGyro-XYZ  
* fBodyAccMag  
* fBodyAccJerkMag  
* fBodyGyroMag  
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:  
* mean(): Mean value  
* std(): Standard deviation  
* mad(): Median absolute deviation  
* max(): Largest value in array  
* min(): Smallest value in array  
* sma(): Signal magnitude area  
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.  
* iqr(): Interquartile range  
* entropy(): Signal entropy  
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:  
* gravityMean  
* tBodyAccMean  
* tBodyAccJerkMean  
* tBodyGyroMean  
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

**For each record it is provided:**  
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.  
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.  
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.  
* Its activity label.  
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

**The downloaded dataset (the zip file) includes the following files:**  
* 'README.txt'  
* 'features_info.txt' - Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.  
* 'features.txt' - List of all features.

The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.  
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.  
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
